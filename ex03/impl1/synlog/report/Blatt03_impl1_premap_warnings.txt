@W: MT529 :"c:\users\flori\iclouddrive\uni\sose24\fpga\sheets\blatt03\ex03\ex03_clkdiv.vhd":28:4:28:5|Found inferred clock ex03_top_lfsr|i_clk which controls 20 sequential elements including e_clkdiv.clk. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
