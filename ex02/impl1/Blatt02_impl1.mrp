GSR Usage
---------

GSR Component:
   The local reset signal 'i_reset_n_c' of the design has been inferred as
        Global Set Reset (GSR). The reset signal used for GSR control is
        'i_reset_n_c'.
        

     GSR Property:
   The design components with GSR property set to ENABLED will respond to global
        set reset while the components with GSR property set to DISABLED will
        not.

GSR Usage (cont)
----------------

     Components on inferred reset domain with GSR Property disabled
--------------------------------------------------------------

     These components have the GSR property set to DISABLED and are on the
     inferred reset domain. The components will respond to the reset signal
     'i_reset_n_c' via the local reset on the component and not the GSR
     component.

     Type and number of components of the type: 
   Register = 1 

     Type and instance name of component: 
   Register : e_debouncer/last_d

Run Time and Memory Usage
-------------------------

   Total CPU Time: 0 secs  
   Total REAL Time: 0 secs  
   Peak Memory Usage: 58 MB
