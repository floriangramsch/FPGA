@W: MT529 :"c:\users\flori\iclouddrive\uni\sose24\fpga\sheets\blatt00\impl1\source\ex00_top.vhd":52:8:52:9|Found inferred clock ex00_top|i_clk which controls 24 sequential elements including cnt[23:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
